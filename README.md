# Reference-Vector-Evolutionary-Algorithm

This is a port of the RVEA (Reference Vector guided Evolutionary Algorithm) for many-objective optimization in R. The original algorithm is in MATLAB and can be found at [https://github.com/ranchengcn/RVEA_Matlab](https://github.com/ranchengcn/RVEA_Matlab)


Start with the RVEA_NEW folder.
  - The Main.R contains an example.
  - The utils.R contains Matlab to R utility functions
  - F_misc.R contains functions used by RVEA

The example used in Main.R is the viennet example.. it can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mopsocd/mopsocd.pdf
